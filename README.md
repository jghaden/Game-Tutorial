# C++ Game Tutorial
C++ tutorial for making a basic framework to easily construct a game with user made rooms and maps

## Why this Tutorial?
Some people have trouble figuring out what to do for a small project to continue their learning for a programming language. This C++ tutorial avoids the boring details of only covering data types, variables, etc. and applys the previous knowledge of the language to write a Windows console game from scratch.
